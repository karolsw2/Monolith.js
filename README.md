# Monolith.js
A 3D javascript isometric game engine made with three.js

The goal of the project is to make creating 3D isomteric games extremally simple.
The engine will be responsible for creating the game board and attaching the objects to it, detecting collisions, providing mouse controls and keyboard events.

Declarative programming wins!
